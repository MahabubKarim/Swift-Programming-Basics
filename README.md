## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MahabubKarim/Swift-Programming-Basics.git
   cd Swift-Programming-Basics
   ```

2. **Open with Xcode:**
   - Open `Swift-Programming-Basics.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
   - Alternatively, you can open individual `.swift` files or any Xcode playgrounds with Xcode.

3. **Swift Version:**
   - This project uses Swift 5.x. Make sure you have it installed.

## Usage

- Browse through the folders and files to find Swift examples on variables, control flow, functions, classes, and more.
- Run examples in Xcode by selecting a file and pressing the "Run" button, or use the Swift REPL:
   ```bash
   swift filename.swift
   ```
- For interactive exploration, open any included `.playground` files with Xcode and run code cells directly.

## Project Structure

- `/Basics/` – Fundamental concepts like variables, constants, and data types.
- `/ControlFlow/` – If statements, loops, and switch cases.
- `/Functions/` – Example functions, parameters, and return values.
- `/ClassesAndStructs/` – Introduction to classes, structs, and object-oriented basics.
- `/Playgrounds/` – Xcode playgrounds for interactive learning (open with Xcode).
- Other files – Additional examples and notes.

## Playgrounds

- Xcode playgrounds in this repository provide hands-on Swift examples. Open them in Xcode to see code output live and interactively experiment with Swift syntax and concepts.
- To use a playground:
  1. Double-click the `.playground` file in Finder or Xcode.
  2. Review the code sections, modify as desired, and press the "Run" button to see results.
- Each playground is focused on a specific Swift topic, allowing you to learn by doing.
